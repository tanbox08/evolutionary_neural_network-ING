Using evolutionary algorithm to search for a great neural network architecture.

##### Current Situation

​	Basically, we'll use MNIST as our test bench now.

​	The preliminary goal we want to achieve is evolving an neural network that can rival the [model](https://github.com/zh-plus/NN_example/tree/master/CNN) in my NN_example repository, i.e. approximately 99.6 test accuracy in MNIST data set.



In the future, we will also adapt it into more data set, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.
